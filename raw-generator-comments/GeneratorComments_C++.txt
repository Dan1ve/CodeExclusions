INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION - DO NOT USE IN USER CODE. ParameterizedTestCaseInfo accumulates tests obtained from TEST_P macro invocations for a particular test case and generators obtained from INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P macro invocations for that test case. It registers tests with all values generated by all generators when asked.
